# PORTFOLIO PAGES

This section consists the code for my personal porfolio/CV pages. The page is made with HTML code mixed with Bootstrap CSS framework for the design. 

The design is pretty simple for a clear viewing experience. The purpose was to exercise my web developing skills to make a responsive mobile-first web page that works smoothly.

The page works as a personal introduction, CV and a link-tree for my social accounts, Github and contact information.
