# PORTFOLIO
Welcome! 

This repository is for my works at my studies as a IT engineer. I study information and communications technology at Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences. It's currently my 3rd year of my 4-year engineer studies plan. Here I can show my skills from various works and projects for possible future employers.
